# Introduction
## Business purpose
The purpose of the business is to provide a personalized management for social media accounts and allow the customer to focus on producing media (rather than managing responses to an unknown number of consumers). The organization Personal Social Media Managment is pursuing new business because chat responses have been increasing in recent times. In the past it was simple to respond to responses due to their low frequency, but now it is past our staffs' abilities. And we are pursuing the use of a bot software to help manage these influxes of responses instead of continuing to hire an increasingly unknown number of new staff.

## Business scope
The business domain is defined by its name: Personal Social Media Managment. It is responsible for managing the public image and estimating public response to the media produced across multiple accounts. The range of the business activities is monitoring, compiling data, and responding to user inputs across all social media accounts. The proposed system changes would allow all responses to be recorded, analyzed, and responded to within three business days. It is currently only possible to provide the features to top voted comments of 100 likes or more and within seven business days.

## Overview
The major internal divisions of the business are the public image data collection based off of tags or direct interactions, monitoring public sentiment in future projections from data collected, and responding to comments left by users. The external entities of the business are the online users that interact with the media produced or individuals or organizations that affect the public perception of the client. The online consumers of the client's social media accounts interact with the three internal divisions in different ways. Any user that provides a tag, hashtag, at, or direct interaction to the client's social media provides data to be collected. This data is then fed to the future projections division to allow the company to select crafted responses aimed at improving public perception. These solutions are then transferred to the response division that implements the preferred response to the public.

## Definitions
User Response - Any consumer of client's social media accounts that leaves a reaction to content.

Client Response - The client's chosen response to specific reactions.

Public Perception - The current perceived public interaction levels and image based off user averages.

Future Perception - The projected public interaction levels and image based off user averages and analysists.

Hashtags - # Symbol to link to topics related to client's social media accounts.

Ats - @ Symbol to link to topics related to client's social media accounts.

## Major stakeholders
The major stakeholder is the content creator that hires the company to review the success of the social media branding. The client's opinion of the business success determines the continuation and direction of the company and company responses to online users. The goal of the company is to improve the quantity and quality of user interaction with their social media branding. The image and specific interaction the client wants to create is subjective, thus the client is intricately involved and updated during all three divisions based off of changes to interaction averages and has the ability to direct responses and override analyst solutions.

## Business environment
Some internal environmental factors that could be taken into consideration are the potential for analysts to fail in projecting public image and future interaction levels. This could be due to poor data collection, poor projection tools, or the human condition being variable. Some external environmental factor at play are online users that do not interact with the client's social media directly, but still provide options on the client, making it difficult to track. Other external environmental factors are other social media creators that may help or hinder client's social engagement and the platforms that host the social media accounts. With the change of bots aiding the divisions in increased levels of user engagement, the client should still be able to review potential responses and direct them as needed. The bot must be in compliance with the rules of each social media page in regard to responses. And the bot should have as strict security measures as the client's own social media accounts.

## Mission, goals, and objectives
The desired business result to be obtained through this proposed system are an increase in consumer interaction through likes, comments, subscribes, followers, shares, or mentions by at least ten percent. And there is a desired increase in response to consumer interactions by fifty percent.

## Business model
This business mission is expected to be achieved by the change in responsibility for the response division, and an increase in the bot generation of responses. The generated responses will initially be reviewed by team members and averages to be reviewed by client before approval. Once the bot responses reach ninety percent approval rating from the review team, the bot can hold the main responsibility of responding to consumers but will still be supervised by review team on a as need basis. The bot's responses will all be recorded and sent to the projection team for further analysis on perception.

## Information environment
The project portfolio is to have the priority be all three divisions pursuing the same overall business goal, which is to increase the amount of positive growth in terms of consumer interaction, but by different means. The long-term system plan is to increase client interaction with an increasing consumer base in continued positive manner, without added strain to company employees. The database configuration should be designed in such a way that it holds all linked consumer reactions and search results be recorded and organized. It should be provided to both the future projections division on social engagement and the bot in charge of generating responses to consumers.

# Business operational requirements
## Business processes
The business activities should include the first team - collection and organization of public data that is linked to the client's social media accounts, the sharing of this data to the future projections team, the second team - the projected results of possible client responses, the third section - the bot generation of potential client responses to specific consumer interactions based off of projection division proposed solutions, and a review by the fourth response division to ensure compliance to projection divisions desired solutions and social media accounts terms and service.

## Business operational policies and rules
The business has the operational rules to not break any terms of service contracts with the social media companies hosting the accounts. And it also follows the terms and service of the advertisers for the content creator. It also has strict security measures to follow for all accounts, all devices that access the account, the company, and the bot's access and internal security.

## Business operational constraints
The conditions to be imposed in conducting the business process are that the bot will respond within 3 business days and the response will follow terms and service of the involved social media page. And every occurrence of the bot generating a response will be recorded and reviewed within seven business days by the fourth division.

## Business operational modes
The necessary methods to conduct the business operation in an unsteady state are to update proposed response timeframes when there are extreme influxes of interaction with the system to avoid burnout from employees and computer systems. The second division - projection team - will develop these new timeframes and their lengths based off of current events. If the system loses power due to external events, it will have a statement by the client provided the social media companies' servers are not down and the statement will update on potential working dates.

## Business operational quality
The level of quality required for the business operation is higher than the reliability of a quick response. The need for client responses that elicit growth in the client's content channels is ranked higher than the need for the bot or other divisions to respond quickly to an influx of data or interactions.

## Business structure
The structures relevant to the business system are the four divisions. Each division holds a different responsibility. The first division is responsible for collecting any data related to public engagement with the client's social media accounts. The second division is in charge of analyzing the available data and using it to base future projections for consumer interactions. The third division is now the bot division and is responsible for generating responses to user retweets or comments across different platforms. The fourth division is now the review team and is responsible for reviewing the responses posted on behalf of the client to make sure it fits the mission goals of positive engagement and meeting terms and condition contracts.
